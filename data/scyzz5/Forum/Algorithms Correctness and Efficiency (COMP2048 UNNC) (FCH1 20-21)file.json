However, from my perspective, the precondition should be {x=3 and y=1} since we assign x+y (2+1) to x and the value of y (1) is not changed. I'm confused about this example.Also, I don't fully understand why the assignment rule is used backward in proving correctness. Looking forward to your explanation :)\n"}, {"subject": "Prove the correctness of Euclid GCD algorithm", "time": "Thursday, 15 October 2020, 4:07 PM", "context": "\nWhen I read the book Computer science: a modern introduction, 3.3.2, on page 103-104, it gives the proof by induction of the GCD algorithm.

You also mentioned that we can simply refer to partial correctness as total correctness plus cases where the program doesn't terminate.However, for partial correctness, if the program cannot terminate, from my perspective the required output cannot be produced, hence we can not say that program is \"correct\" due to the definition of \"correctness\". I'm a little bit confused about this point.\n"}, {"subject": "inclass exam answers and marks", "time": "Monday, 22 February 2021, 5:48 PM", "context": "\nDear all,Happy New Year!
