This is a great question! First of all, we are not emphasing on GUI implementation in this module, that would be for HCI module in P2 (Year 4). In fact, JavaFX serves as a good tool for teaching the design patterns and principles. Secondly, JavaFX is open-source, and have more developers contributed to its development over the past few years, which is worth to be utilised. Third, more applications developed require high intensive and requirements of graphic quality such as games that are more suitable with other (specific) languages. JavaFX is more lightweight compared to those, and stays popular in many industries, especially on applications that high computational/complex GUI is not mandatory. If someday JavaFX has started to involve games development, it could be different story.I hope this answer the question, and clear the doubt of using JavaFX in this module. Again, focus on the developing maintainable software with design patterns and principles we learnt in this module, instead of programming language.Reference: https://www.javaadvent.com/2019/12/javafx-not-dead-yet.html.\n"}, {"subject": "Early Module Feedback: Timetable Schedule", "time": "Tuesday, 3 November 2020, 1:30 PM", "context": "\nFew students have raised the concern of having 7 hours lectures on Monday, and based on our understanding, P1 students have more time available on Thursday.
